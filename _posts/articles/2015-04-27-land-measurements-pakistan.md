## Background
What pisses me off about the real estate market in Pakistan is lack of standardization when it comes to land measurement. The standard unit appears to be square foot, but when it comes to larger units, especially the marla and kanal, they mean different things in different postal codes, e.g. *1 marla* in Lahore is *225 sqft* while *1 marla* in a place like Sahiwal is *272.25* sqft. Why is that? If you have a science background, you would know about System Internationale and the standardization effort by *the gora*. If the *gora* can standardize measurements all accross europe, surely he must have done this India too. My frustration when I came accross these units was always phrased as this, '*pakistanion ke haath aik units lag gaye, un ka bhi pakar ke satiyanass ker diya*'. 

## Whats with the ambiguity then? 
In doing my research, I was in for a surprize. Apparently, this great ambiguity can be found accross the broder, i.e. India and is left by the gora himself!!. 

The reasons behind this appears to be the distribution crown wasteland for irrigation purposes and then later consiladation efforts of these distribution for taxation and legal purposes. During the initial stages of British rule over India, there were a couple of efforts made by them to understand the local agricultural practices and taxation policies. Early efforts such as [East India Irrigation and Canal Act of 1869](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Irrigation_and_Canal_Act_1869) and [The great trignometric survey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Trigonometrical_Survey) points to imperial attemt to strenthen their rule over India.

*The great trignometric survey* coupled with *East India Irrigation and Canal Act of 1869* standardized land measurements (aabyana) for taxation purposes. Things changed after attempts were made to increase the cultivatable area, by extending the already faboulous canals network and more barrages. After more water was available for irrgation purposes, land settling rights were sold amongst people. *The great trignometric survey* quantified the sellable area for government
